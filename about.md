My name is **Bessie Malek**.  I live and code in **Dallas, TX**, but I'm originally from Illinois.  Not the Chicago part.  The other part where they grow corn.

I build web and database applications.  I like the ability to organize data and to make something useful.  So far, my career looks like this:

I like developing in *Node.js*{: style="color: red"} the best because of NPM--free code that gets shared and re-used.

My current goal is getting AWS Solution Architect certified.  Code that's never deployed to a server is boring...
